# Coffee Vending Machine Sales Analysis

# 📌 Project Overview
- This project presents a comprehensive analysis of sales data from a coffee vending machine. The goal is to uncover actionable insights regarding  **customer purchasing behavior, sales performance, payment preferences**, and **product popularity**.  
- The findings are intended to support data-driven decision-making and optimize the vending machine's operational efficiency and profitability.

# 🔍 Key Insights

**💳 Preferred Payment Method:** Card payments dominate over cash transactions.  
**☕ Top-Selling Beverages:** Latte and Americano with Milk lead as the most popular items.  
**🕒 Peak Sales Hours:** Morning hours, particularly between 9 AM and 11 AM, record the highest transaction volume.  
**📅 Sales Distribution:** Sales are stronger on weekdays, with distinct patterns observed across different months.  
**🎯 Customer Retention:** A small subset of loyal customers is responsible for a significant proportion of repeat purchases.  

# 🎯 Next Steps / Recommendations  
- Consider offering promotions during non-peak hours to balance the sales load.  
- Analyze customer cards further to identify demographics behind loyal customers.  
- Monitor the least popular products to assess if they should be replaced or promoted differently.
